Final program should have:
1. input pdb files for training
2. when given a new pdb file with designated sequence to test, it should:
	a. determine signature
	b. based on signature, retrieve relevant descriptor set
	c. determine conditional probability value of that
	d. multiply this probability value with the signature probability value

For that, program need to have 1. signature, and 2. probability distributions 
based on residue and position. 

we'll therefore calculate everything first, and then split based on residue for each position.

Need a separate script from plot.py to do that. 

So, index by relative_sno, and then index by res. Then output probability distribution (as what form though? we already have all the points.) 

For now, we'll assume that apart from signature residue, the rest are independent.

So, i need a query function, how well does this new datapoint cluster with the existing set of datapoints. 

First, plot it out in 2D to see, then assume normal distribution for each? Plot to verify that it is normal.

Task: Focus on building the plot first.
