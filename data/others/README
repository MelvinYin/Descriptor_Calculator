1. Signature Dx[DN]xDG
Reference JMB 343(4):971-984 and PloS One 6(6):e21507

Let's consider the first Asp in the signature #1
We are interested in #1 - 10 positions, and Asp #3 + 20 positions
Total: 35 positions

EF hand has 29 consecutive amino acid residues: 9 helix, 9 loop, 11 helix

2. Chemistry

* Canonical EF Hand:

Ca2+ coordination involves 7 groups:
5 groups are provided by EF hand residues in the loop:
    3-4 carboxy groups D/E
    1 carbonyl in the backbone
2 come from a carboxylate in the side chain of an acidic  a.a. in the exiting helix
frequently complemented by a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to the loop

notation liner (pentagonal-bipyramid): 1(+X), 3(+Y), 5(+Z), 7(-Y), 9 (-X), 12 (-Z)

Numerous intra-loop hydrogen bonds
Conserved glycine(6) has unusual phi 60, psi 20 resulting in 90 turn
residue 8 - conserved hydrophobe: short anti-parallel beta-sheet
position 9 - HB with position 12 initiates the helix

* Non-canonical EF Hand
