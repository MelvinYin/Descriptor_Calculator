EM for clustering?

Ideas from discussion 06/08/2018:
1. Overall workflow of descriptor program should be:
a. Take in certain biological function as input (say, break down substrate A)
b. Using pre-determined clusters (see master's thesis), automatically determine elementary functions required.
c. For each elementary function, retrieve corresponding descriptor, which contains structural parameter tolerance ranges, examples, possible dependence on structural parameters of other nodes, etc.
d. Using these ranges, supply to Rosetta for optimisation, to determine ideal configuration.

Descriptor therefore acts like a pre-optimiser, decreasing search space for Rosetta.

Rosetta might be able to do the whole process by brute force, through getting function matching and energy minimising. Descriptor therefore allows a narrowing of the search space, instead of everything possible, just search within these ranges with these tolerances/standard deviations. 

2. For master's thesis, 3 points:
a. Link to descriptor, issue with thesis using sequence only while descriptor need structural info matching. Structural info matching will allow for far more accurate clusters, but then is it possible? Many more dimensions, requiring a far larger dataset? Also, how do we "make" a similarity criterion/parameter? Possible?

b. Might be able to come up with better cluster algorithm. E.g. use EM, then can skip the whole minimising-number-of-cluster part.
But, Alex has apparently done some implementations, they also have manuscripts, wait for him to send you first to see how to make better. Alex is stuck on how to make more accurate (cluster?) predictions. Wait for him to send you stuff before starting work, igor has been informed.

c. thesis algorithm can be used as a fallback, in case insufficient dataset/structural info, then just use sequence to cluster, maybe. Or this can be reflected in relevant weight metric, increase weights for small datasets to sequence, and decrease for larger datasets, where other structural parameters will be better defined then.
